# grunt-svninfo

> A Grunt.js plugin that provides easy access to Subversion working copy metadata (svn info).

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.0`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-svninfo --save-dev
```

One the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-svninfo');
```

That's about it, no configuration necessary.

## The "svninfo" task

### Overview
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `svninfo` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.
Executing the task `svninfo` would run `svn info` in the command line and would make the retrieved data available via grunt.config (e.g. `<%= svninfo.rev %>`) in your build.
The resulting `svninfo` object has the following structure:


```js
{
  "rev": "321",
  "url": "https://yourproject.unfuddle.com/svn/repo/trunk",
  "last": {
 	  "rev": "321",
 	  "author": "me",
 	  "date": "2013-02-10 12:35:30 +0200"
  },
  "repository": {
 	  "root": "https://yourproject.unfuddle.com/svn/repo",
 	  "id": "f5d41312-1fa6-4ca6-a93e-e27d7e98fc43"
  }
}
```

### Options

#### cwd
Type: `String`

Allows to specify a cwd (current working directory) path for the SVN repository of which to retrieve the information. The default directory is the where you run grunt from (`'.'`).

Example:
``` js
svninfo: {
  options: {
    cwd: './myproject/ishere'
  },
  ...
}
```

#### output
Type: `String`

Allows to specify a custom object that would contain the retrieved and parsed SVN info. Defaults to 'svninfo'. This feature came about to support projects with multiple external dependencies ("extenals"), in which each external would have its own info object instead of having them override each other with each 'info' call.

Example:
``` js
svninfo: {
  options: {
    output: 'myExternal_svninfo'
  },
  ...
}
```

#### revision arg
Type: `String`

Allows to specify a custom revision or date. Revision range is not supported by svn info command.
Revision arg must be one supported by svn info command. From the svn info help:
```
Valid options:
  -r [--revision] ARG      : ARG (some commands also take ARG1:ARG2 range)
                             A revision argument can be one of:
                                NUMBER       revision number
                                '{' DATE '}' revision at start of the date
                                'HEAD'       latest in repository
                                'BASE'       base rev of item's working copy
                                'COMMITTED'  last commit at or before BASE
                                'PREV'       revision just before COMMITTED
```

Example:
``` js
svninfo: {
  options: {
    revision: 'HEAD'
  },
  ...
}
```

It is possible, as `svninfo` is a multitask to specify differents commands:
``` js
svninfo: {
  remote: {
    revision: 'HEAD'
  },
  local: {
    revision: 'BASE'
  },
  since: {
    revision: '{YYYYMMDD}' // date format
  },
  ...
}
```
